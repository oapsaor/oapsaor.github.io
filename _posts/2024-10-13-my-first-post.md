# My first blog post!
I don't really know what to write here, as I haven't solved any problem since I took the Brazilian Math Olympiad. So, stay with the statement of problem five.

Find all functions $f:$ $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x^2y-y)=f(x)^2f(y)+f(x)^2-1$.

Really cool (but quite challenging) problem.
