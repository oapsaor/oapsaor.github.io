# Inequalities.

Erm, I'm creating this because I'm kind of stupid and I always forget something about the main inequalities. So, to fix this problem, I'm writing them all here.

### Main results


##### AM-GM
Given non-negative reals $$a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}$$, we have $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq \sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}}$$.
Equality holds if and only if $$a_{1}=\dots=a_{n}$$.


##### Muirhead
Given non-negative reals $$a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}$$, and two sequences $$x$$ and $$y$$, such that $$x$$ majorizes $$y$$, we have
$$ \sum_{sym} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{x_{i}} \geq \sum_{sym} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{y_{i}}$$.
Equality happens if and only if $$a_{1} = \dots = a_{n}$$


##### Schur

Let $$a$$, $$b$$ and $$c$$ be non-negative real numbers and $$r>0$$. We have that $$\sum_{cyc} a^{r}(a^2+bc) \geq \sum_{cyc} a^{r+1}(b+c)$$.
Equality happens if and only if $$a=b=c$$, or two terms are equal and the other is zero.


##### Weighted Power Mean




##### HÃ¶lder
Let $$p$$ and $$q$$ be positive real numbers and $$a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}$$; $$b_{1}, \dots, b_{n}$$ be non-negative reals. We have
$$ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \right)^p \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i} \right)^q \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt[p+q]{a_{i}^p b_{i}^q} \right)^{p+q} $$.
Equality holds if and only if $$ \frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}} = \dots = \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} = \lambda $$.
